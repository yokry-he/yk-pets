# AI Development Handoff

## 1. Collaboration boundaries

- Repository: `yokry-he/yk-pets`
- Sole development branch: `agent/cloud-fox-studio-v0610`
- PR #7 targets `agent/yk-pets-rebrand-v0610`.
- Do not merge without an explicit user request. Run full CI for every independent batch and update the PR only after green.
- New sessions must verify HEAD, PR state, and CI from GitHub; this file intentionally stores no live SHA.

## 2. Canonical architecture

- Sole production composition: `apps/playground/app/components/studio/ExtensionAlignedCloudFox.vue`
- Shared preview: `apps/playground/app/components/studio/CloudFoxStudioCanvas.vue`
- Framework-neutral motion domain: `packages/pet-core/src/motion/`
- Studio routes: `/studio/appearance`, `/studio/motion`, `/studio/props`, `/studio/library`

Do not copy a second pet topology or create another continuously running WebGL scene.

## 3. Completed capabilities

### Appearance and unified Studio

The complete Appearance Studio, shared navigation, local StudioSession, stable motion/prop IDs, shared library, and sole production renderer are complete.

### Semantic Rig and keyframe domain

- `cloud-fox-semantic-rig/v1`;
- millisecond timing with FPS display metadata;
- schema v2 motions, tracks, keyframes, and v1-to-v2 migration;
- clamping, track merging, and last-input-wins duplicate times;
- `step`/`linear` and `once`/`loop`/`ping-pong`;
- deterministic UI-free pose evaluation.

### Timeline authoring and production preview

- Independent motion drafts, undo/redo, dirty state, and save;
- playhead, play/pause/stop, and loop modes;
- writing, deleting, copying, pasting, moving, and multi-selecting keyframes;
- FPS snapping and exact millisecond entry;
- semantic pose editing for root, body, head, front/hind paws, ears, eyes, mouth, tail, and antennae;
- one `EvaluatedCloudFoxPose` evaluation per frame;
- one immutable pose passed through the sole production preview and consumed by thin semantic adapters;
- breathing, blinking, gaze, and existing expressions retained on unauthored channels;
- the thirty built-in motion runtime paths remain unchanged.

### Prop-event tracks

- Stable prop and instance IDs.
- Create, show, attach, detach, move, hide, style, and destroy events.
- Mount/world-space instance evaluation.
- Color, opacity, glow, and particle rate.
- Missing-dependency diagnostics and deletion-cleanup foundations.
- Instances rendered in the sole production TresCanvas.
- Deterministic hold, throw, catch, and effect authoring.

### Prop Studio entity editing

- Schema v2 parametric prop entities and legacy metadata migration.
- Sphere, box, cylinder, cone, torus, capsule, crystal, text plaque, and particle components.
- Component hierarchy, local transforms, duplication, and recursive deletion.
- Color, opacity, metalness, roughness, glow color, and glow intensity.
- Internal `origin`, `grip`, `display`, and `emitter` anchors.
- Budgets of 48 components, 240 particles, and bounded text.
- Local JSON import/export and shared production-scene model preview.

## 4. Explicitly incomplete

- Advanced interpolation for prop events;
- smooth/Bézier interpolation, curve editing, onion skinning, and motion paths;
- mirroring, pose presets, motion layers, interruption policy, IK, and audio tracks;
- security-reviewed local GLB import;
- browser screenshot baselines;
- real Chrome Side Panel, GPU, and WebGL manual acceptance.

## 5. Motion consumption chain

`StudioMotionAssetV2 -> normalizeMotionAsset -> resolveMotionTime -> evaluateNormalizedMotionAsset -> EvaluatedCloudFoxPose -> CloudFoxStudioCanvas -> ProceduralPet -> ExtensionAlignedCloudFox -> semantic part adapters`

Evaluate once per frame. Store pose offsets relative to base appearance mounts and proportions; never mutate the appearance recipe.

## 6. Next phase

The next phase is `advanced-motion-tools`:

1. Smooth/Bézier interpolation and curve editing.
2. Onion skinning and motion paths.
3. Left/right mirroring, pose presets, motion layers, and interruption policy.
4. Optional IK assistance and local audio tracks.
5. Define safe local GLB import budgets, validation, and fallback.
6. Preserve the sole production renderer and one long-running WebGL scene.

## 7. Manual acceptance still required

- Real-browser v1-to-v2 migration, refresh restoration, and rollback.
- Timeline dragging, keyboard operations, and custom-motion save/restore.
- Real Chrome Side Panel, GPU/WebGL, depth ordering, and final pixels.

## 8. Mandatory policy

Every feature commit modifying `apps/` or `packages/` must update `.ai/project-state.json` and at least one handoff context in the same commit. `scripts/check-ai-handoff.mjs` enforces this per commit.

Trust order: actual code and runtime results > latest full CI > machine state > ADR/handoff > PR > old chat history.
